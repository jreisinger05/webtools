# My Webtools class project!

My project includes HTML and CSS. Feel free to view the pages and enjoy the sillier inclusions. Also go play [UNDERTALE](https://undertale.com/), the 10th anniversary happened as of writing this and it's a wonderful game!

Used W3.CSS to update the nav bar at the top, adding buttons to each page--also, added a quote to the index page. I've also updated the table on the success page to be a W3.CSS table, updated the input methods on the contact page to use W3.CSS, as well as the content navigation panel on the index page (a list). Some of these elements have also been updated with colors from the same library that I felt fit with my pre-existing color scheme. W3.CSS has been a very handy library, and I like how many options it gives me built-in. It's much easier than doing it myself, but I suppose the benefit of doing it myself is having even more customization--especially when it comes to colors and whatnot.
