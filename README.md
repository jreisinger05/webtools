# My Webtools class project!

My project includes HTML and CSS. Feel free to view the pages and enjoy the sillier inclusions. Also go play [UNDERTALE](https://undertale.com/), the 10th anniversary happened as of writing this and it's a wonderful game!

Used W3.CSS to update the nav bar at the top, adding buttons to each page--also, added a quote to the index page. I've also updated the table on the success page to be a W3.CSS table. I've also updated the input methods on the contact page to use W3.CSS, as well as the content navigation panel on the index page (a list).
