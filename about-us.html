            <p>This is where you can learn about us. Or, me. Is there an us? I dunno. I guess my classmates kind of count, but this is mainly my website. I did mostly introduce myself on the main page, but...actually, why don't I just paste that? One second, (ahem): My name is Jackson Reisinger, and I'm a student at Dallas College. I love doing digital art and creative things in my free time, as well as playing video games (one of my favorite underrated picks being the Klonoa series; I also like UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE by Toby Fox) and reading/watching series like One Piece (which is probably my personal favorite piece of media, like, ever. Both the manga and the anime are wonderful, and even the Netflix adaptation is really good). Aside from all that, I sometimes love tinkering with technology and computers, so this class is very cool and useful to me! (phew)</p>
