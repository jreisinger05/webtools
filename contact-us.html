            <p>This is the page where the contact information goes. You can use it to contact me. Or, us. I guess. I guess there's kind of an "us" even though it's moreso a "me." I AM in a class, after all. This is a placeholder, by the way. It's probably easy to tell that, but I figure I should specify. For the assignment. The assignment for the class that I'm in. Anyway, my email's at the bottom of the page. On, like, every page. It's part of the footer. So. Yeah. If you wanna email me, have fun, I might check it. Maybe.</p>
