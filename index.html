            <h3 id="about-me" class="heading-3">About Me!</h3>
            <p>My name is Jackson Reisinger, and I'm a student at Dallas College. I love doing digital art and creative
                things in my free time, as well as playing video games (one of my favorite underrated picks being the
                Klonoa series; I also like UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE by Toby Fox) and reading/watching series like One
                Piece (which is probably my personal favorite piece of media, like, ever. Both the manga and the anime
                are wonderful, and even the Netflix adaptation is really good). Aside from all that, I sometimes love
                tinkering with technology and computers, so this class is very cool and useful to me!</p>

                    <h4>Life Goals</h4>
                    <p>If I had to think about the long run, my goals in life are mostly just to live peacefully and retire
                    fulfilled, being able to do what I want and love all the while. In my day-to-day, I try to remain
                    optimistic, both for the sake of myself and my loved ones, and though it's hard sometimes in the chaotic
                    world we live in, I try to be a source of laughs for them and a break from the bad stuff.</p>

            <h3 id="dev-id" class="heading-3">Developer Identity</h3>
            <p>I'm currently attending Dallas College, pursuing an associates' degree or certificate in Software
                Development. I want to get a job in this field both because it's something I enjoy and also something in
                high demand right now, and I hope to possibly turn an avid interest of mine into a career. Whether it
                actually be HTML, or it's something else like developing apps or programming games (which, in my opinion
                would be ideal actually), I hope this develops into something further in my future.</p>

                <h4>Code Experience</h4>
                <p>Due to my very big interest in videogames, I've been doing code in school since high school, and in
                    summer camps even before that--since junior high, I believe. Because of this, I've had plenty of time to
                    get accustomed to how code speaks in general, and adjust according to each language. I like seeing my
                    coding assignments as though they're puzzles; you've got a problem, and you need it solved, and coding
                    is going to do that.</p>
            </div>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3 id="learn-journey" class="heading-3">Learning Journey</h3>
            <p>With this course, I hope to get more experience in unfamiliar coding languages. I'm not experienced in
                HTML, so expanding my brain and becoming more literate in it and other types of code could come in handy
                for my future, and it's also just plain interesting to see the new language, its commonalities with
                others, its differences, and experiment with it all. That's kind of the main reason I decided to take
                the class. So far, it seems easy enough to understand.</p>

                <h4>My Webtools Class</h4>
                <p>I'm very much enjoying the potential for customization and website creation thus far, and learning about
                    how some people develop websites and how deep the customization goes. Though I've never made a website
                    before, learning HTML opens up opportunities for both new hobbies and cool careers. I have to say, I'm
                    not entirely interested in the AI side of things and I'll definitely be trying to use it sparingly, but
                    I do understand the reasons it may be useful.</p>
