        <section> 
              <h3>About Me!</h3>
            <p>My name is Jackson Reisinger, and I'm a student at Dallas College. I love doing digital art and creative things in my free time, as well as playing video games (one of my favorite underrated picks being the Klonoa series; I also like UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE by Toby Fox) and reading/watching series like One Piece (which is probably my personal favorite piece of media, like, ever. Both the manga and the anime are wonderful, and even the Netflix adaptation is really good). Aside from all that, I sometimes love tinkering with technology and computers, so this class is very cool and useful to me!</p>
            <p>If I had to think about the long run, my goals in life are mostly just to live peacefully and retire fulfilled, being able to do what I want and love all the while. In my day-to-day, I try to remain optimistic, both for the sake of myself and my loved ones, and though it's hard sometimes in the chaotic world we live in, I try to be a source of laughs for them and a break from the bad stuff.</p>

             <h3>Developer Identity</h3>
            <p>I'm currently attending Dallas College, pursuing an associates' degree or certificate in Software Development. I want to get a job in this field both because it's something I enjoy and also something in high demand right now, and I hope to possibly turn an avid interest of mine into a career. Whether it actually be HTML, or it's something else like developing apps or programming games (which, in my opinion would be ideal actually), I hope this develops into something further in my future.</p>
            <p>Due to my very big interest in videogames, I've been doing code in school since high school, and in summer camps even before that--since junior high, I believe. Because of this, I've had plenty of time to get accustomed to how code speaks in general, and adjust according to each language. I like seeing my coding assignments as though they're puzzles; you've got a problem, and you need it solved, and coding is going to do that.</p>

              <h3>Learning Journey</h3>
            <p>With this course, I hope to get more experience in unfamiliar coding languages. I'm not experienced in HTML, so expanding my brain and becoming more literate in it and other types of code could come in handy for my future, and it's also just plain interesting to see the new language, its commonalities with others, its differences, and experiment with it all. That's kind of the main reason I decided to take the class. So far, it seems easy enough to understand.</p>
            <p>I'm very much enjoying the potential for customization and website creation thus far, and learning about how some people develop websites and how deep the customization goes. Though I've never made a website before, learning HTML opens up opportunities for both new hobbies and cool careers. I have to say, I'm not entirely interested in the AI side of things and I'll definitely be trying to use it sparingly, but I do understand the reasons it may be useful.</p>
